# Zero Knowledge Drug verification system

The ZK Drug Verification System is a web application that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. It allows drug designers to input drug components and generates a proof and public signals based on the input. Users can then verify the proof to determine if the drug is safe. The system ensures privacy and trust in drug verification processes.
